The dataset for this minilab is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) and contains reviews of different wine varieties (location, winery, price).

# MVP

<br>

**Question 1.** 

Read in the data and investigate it, e.g. variables, variable types, dimensions etc.
```{r}
class(minilab)
```

<br>

**Question 2.** 

Select columns `title`, `taster_name`, `points`, `price`, and `country`, then **drop all NAs**. Save into a variable called `wine_subset`. Use this variable for all subsequent tasks.

<br>

**Question 3.** 

Find the 5 countries with the highest mean points.

<br>

**Question 4.** 

Find the 5 countries with the lowest mean prices.

<br>

**Question 5.** 

Does the result differ if you use the median instead of the mean for Questions 3 and 4?

<br>

**Question 6.** 

Find the names of all the tasters using `distinct`. Then take a random sample of 5 names using `sample_n`. Save these 5 names into a new variable called `taster_sample` which should be a **character vector** containing only the names. 

<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>: You can use the function `pull` to extract a single column as a vector.
</details>

<br>

**Question 7**

Do the same thing for `country`, i.e. create a **character vector** called `country_sample` using `distinct` and `pull`, but this time use `sample_frac` to pick 10 countries at random. 

<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>: What is the proportion of countries you want? $\frac{Part}{Whole}$
</details>

<br>

**Question 8**

Filter the rows of `wine_subset` so you are left only with data from the 5 tasters in your `taster_sample` and from the countries in your `country_sample`. Save this into a new variable called `wine_sample`.

<br>

**Question 9**

Using your `wine_sample`, create a new column `difference_from_avg` which contains the difference between each wine's rating (`points`) and the average rating for that taster, then arrange the differences to see the highest positive difference first. [**Hint:** you will first have to calculate the average points for each taster]
