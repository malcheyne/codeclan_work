# This absolute file path

Not good for reperjusing with other people
```{r}
read_csv("~/Code/GitHub/codeclan_work/Week_02/Day_4/3_relative_filepaths/project_example/data/students.csv")
```


# 

This is better as I can share just folder/project and theres no loss of data
```{r}
read_csv("3_relative_filepaths/project_example/data/students.csv")
```
