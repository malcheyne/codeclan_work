# Calculating the complement of an event

The probability of $A^{c}$, $\textrm{prob}(A^c)$ is simply equal to $1-\textrm{prob}(A)$ since an event **has to either occur or not occur**, so 

$$\textrm{prob}(A)+\textrm{prob}(A^c) = 1$$.


```{r}
s_four_coins <- tosscoin(4) %>% 
  mutate(row = row_number())

s_four_coins
```


```{r}
s_four_coins <- s_four_coins %>% 
  mutate(num_heads = rowSums(. == "H"))

s_four_coins
```

```{r}
s_at_least_two_heads <- s_four_coins %>% 
  filter(num_heads >= 2)

prob_two_plus_heads <- nrow(s_at_least_two_heads) / nrow(s_four_coins)

prob_two_plus_heads

# get the observations where there are less than 2 heads
# s_at_least_two_heads <- s_four_coins %>% 
#   filter(num_heads < 2)

# calculate the probability
# prob_less_two <- nrow(s_less_than_two_heads) / nrow(s_four_coins)
# prob_less_two
```

# AND combinations

In probability theory, we call this the **intersection** $\cap$ of the two event spaces.
$$(A \cap B) = \{3,4\}$$

### Task - 5 mins

Given our four coin tossing example from above, what is the probability of tossing at least one head and at least one tail?

    To do this, youâ€™ll need to add a num_tails column to s_four_coins
    Then think about filtering to satisfy the two conditions
```{r}
s_four_coins <- s_four_coins %>% 
  mutate(num_tails = rowSums(. == "T"))

s_four_coins
```

```{r}
s_four_coins %>% 
  filter(num_heads > 0 &
           num_tails > 0) 
```

```{r}
s_four_coins %>% 
  filter(num_heads > 0 &
           num_tails > 0) %>% 
  summarise(prob = n() / nrow(s_four_coins))
```

```{r}
# gives the same as using &
s_four_coins %>% 
  filter(num_heads > 0,
           num_tails > 0)
```

# OR combinations

In probability theory, this involves taking the **union** of the two event spaces:

$$(A \cup B) = \{2,4,5,6\}$$

```{r}
# create our sample space: two die rolls
s_two_dice <- rolldie(2)

# now filter down to cases where X1 is even or X2 is 5
s_two_dice %>% 
  filter(X1 %% 2 == 0 | X2 == 5) %>% 
  summarise(prob = n() / nrow(s_two_dice))
```

### Optional Task - 10 mins

Let's check the addition law for ourselves. Calculate probabilities for each event below:

* $\textrm{first_die_even}$
* $\textrm{second_die_5}$
* $\textrm{first_die_even AND second_die_5}$

Then use these probabilities in the expression from above

$$\textrm{prob}(A \cup B) = \textrm{prob}(A) + \textrm{prob}(B) - \textrm{prob}(A \cap B)$$

and check you get the same probability for $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{first_die_even OR second_die_5})$ as we obtained from the last block of code.

\begin{multline}
\textrm{prob}(\textrm{first_die_even OR second_die_5}) = \\ 
\textrm{prob}(\textrm{first_die_even}) + \textrm{prob}(\textrm{second_die_5}) \\
- \textrm{prob}(\textrm{first_die_even AND second_die_5}) 
\end{multline}
$$

```{r}
first_die_even <- s_two_dice %>%
  filter(X1 %% 2 == 0) %>% 
  summarise(prob = n() / nrow(s_two_dice)) %>% 
  pull()

second_die_5 <- s_two_dice %>% 
  filter(X2 == 5) %>% 
  summarise(prob = n() / nrow(s_two_dice)) %>% 
  pull()

both_con <- s_two_dice %>% 
  filter(X1 %% 2 == 0 & X2 == 5) %>% 
  summarise(prob = n() / nrow(s_two_dice)) %>% 
  pull()

pr_union <- first_die_even + second_die_5 - both_con 

# pull() takes the tibble df and makes it a value to use in the sum above
```
